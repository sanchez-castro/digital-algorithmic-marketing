# The persado_experiment.xlsx file contains a real experiment run by Persado
# Use the data to answer the following questions.

# Q1: Assuming that all relevant variables were tested how many possible
#		message combinations are there? 
# Q2: Estimate two logit models based on the data (assuming a simple linear 
#		specification) - one for opens and another for clicks. Discuss your results based
#		on the nature of the variables (see variable names and descriptions tab).
# Q3: Use the estimated models to compute predicted probabilities for all possible message
# 		combinations (separate predictions for opens and clicks). 
#		Which messages have the highest fitted response probabilities (for opens and clicks each)?
#		Are the two messages similar or different? Discuss.
