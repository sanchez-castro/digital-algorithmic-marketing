# A new DMP claims that hey have a better set of variables
# to match your customers on. 
# In particular, they have an ecom_index which they claim 
# Offers an inrementally better match for you.
# Unfortunately the cost of matching customers via them is 
# significantly higher!

cost = 3.25

# They have given you a sample target dataset 
# and a matched version of your customer dataset
# These are in cust2.rdat and target2.rdat
# Hint: Careful the ecom_index is in the 12th column

# Use this new data to answer the following questions.
# 1. Would you go with the new DMP? Justify your answer.
# 2. Is there any circumstance when you would ignore the
#    matching and go after the entire target file audience? Justify.
